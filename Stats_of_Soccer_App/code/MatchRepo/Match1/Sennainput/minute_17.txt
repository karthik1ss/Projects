17′ YELLOW CARD - Alexander Buttner: Another full-back in the book after a poor challenge against Albrighton. Buttner almost lashes out at his opposite player, and receives a booking from Martin Atkinson.
17′ CLARK! Fine chance for Villa to extend their lead. Great delivery from the right by Albrighton, and it's a free header for Ciaran Clark, who diverts it over the bar.
