FT: MNU 4-1 ASV: Attention now turns to the big one against Bayern in midweek after a good United performance. Rooney's double set United on their way before Mata and Hernandez completed the victory. They remain in seventh place, however. For Villa, the situation gets a little bit difficult, as they could be just six clear of the relegation spots after today's games.
